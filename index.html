<h2>Past</h2>
<img class="left" src="saltlake.jpg" alt="Salt Lake City, Utah.">
<p>  I was born on October 24, 2000 in Salt Lake City, Utah. After that, I lived in a small town just north of there for twelve years. I started out in a small house in Kaysville, Utah where I learned to walk, talk, eat, dance, play, and went to my first years of school. My grandparents lived only a few minutes away so my grandma signed me up for dance class and she and my grandpa would take me to lunch afterwards. I sometimes would just go to play with their dogs. We would also go to their house for Sunday dinners, birthdays and holidays. When I was nine, I moved across town which seemed like the worst thing ever since I had to change elementary schools. When I turned ten, I learned how to ski and <a href="http://www.adogsjourney.com">started training dogs.</a> Three years later, we moved again. This time, we moved across the country to Charlotte, North Carolina. It was difficult for me, but I ended up loving it there too.</p>

<h2>My Present</h2>
<img class="right" src="family.jpg" alt="Me, my dad, my sisters and my little brother mini-golfing.">
<p>There are seven people in my family. I have my mom, dad, two brothers and two sisters. My older brother, Dallin, is eighteen and is serving a full-time church mission in London, England. He left at the beginning of the school year and Iâ€™m still not sure if I miss him. I have two younger sisters, Anna and Emilie, who are twelve and ten. Anna tries to do everything I do, but Emilie wants to do the opposite that Anna does. My youngest brother, Christian, is six. He is not one of those annoying little brothers. He is silly and still likes to sword fight and play dirty, but he is a born little gentleman.</p>

<img class="left" src="dog.jpg" alt="My dog, Lillie.">
<p>My current interests are dance, cooking and training my dog. I <a href="http://danceartsgreenville.com/">dance</a> six to nine hours a week and love it. I mostly a baker, but I like cooking too. I like to decorate cakes and am always looking up <a href="http://pin.it/FjBKiHs">ideas and recipes in my free time.</a> I love dogs and have trained my dog to do tricks like jumping through my arms, over my feet and to hide in a box. Other interests of mine are reading, meeting new people, and doing crafts.</p>

<h2>My Future</h2>

<img class="right" src="they.jpg" alt="Logo for BYU.">
<p>  First, I plan on graduating. After high school, I plan on going to a four year university. The school I want to go to is <a href="https://www.byu.edu/">Brigham Young University</a> in Provo, Utah. I plan to major in something science researched based.

</ul>
